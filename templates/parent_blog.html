      <h2>Public Speaking</h2>

      <p1>Have you ever been in that situation where you were in a crowd and they asked for a volunteer to speak a few words? Did you feel an invisible rope pulling you back to your chair? Did you also watch someone go up and speak and envied their courage? If the answer is yes, do not worry we have all been in the same situation before. But we need to take the leap of faith sometimes and stop living vicariously. For we must remember we only get one shot at these things in life.

        I think with public speaking the crucial word is always the “Leap of Faith”, to believe in yourself even when your whole body is shaking and resisting as you notice the audience and have the courage to climb those steps on to the stage. But it is okay to be nervous and worried, in fact, most great speakers are. Furthermore, it can be stressful for anyone to perform when the spotlight is on them. The first few seconds of your performance is usually the scariest, but once you find your groove and all those hours of practice kick in, you are in it to win it. This is where practising your speech or rehearsing becomes very important. 
        
        You have to put in the work into your speech, and practice hard enough that it becomes muscle memory, so when you are on stage you just go with the flow. However, you must be committed. This is a game-changer and you will notice the difference when you are on stage, as you will look calm and composed because your body knows exactly what to do since it has done those movements or gestures so many times. Practice makes perfect. If it is an extemporaneous speech it may be a little harder, but if you jot down your points or have a few in your head in a sequence that can also work perfectly well. However, if it is not then I would like to re-emphasize that “Practice makes Perfect”. Whenever you are practising do not feel upset when people give you feedback, always tell yourself that it is better that it got spotted now than later, so you can work on it before your big day. But be sure to be always prepared in advance.
        
        Lastly, it is always key to remember that however hard it is to go on to the stage and perform the fact of the matter is the spotlight is on you, it is all about you. You are given an opportunity to showcase all your talent and to go from the person who envied others to become the person people envy. So prepare well in advance, practice, practice, practice and take that leap of faith. For you are ready to go out there and break a leg (please do not take this literally).
